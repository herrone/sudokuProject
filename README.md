_Steps to run from command line;_ 

On a MacBook;
1) navigate to src folder (cd, then drag src folder into terminal and drop)
2) enter javac Sudoku.java
3) enter javac Sudoku 
4) enjoy! :) 

I think this also works on windows, but I haven't been able to test it as I do not have one, and nor do any of my flatmates/friends.
